This is the preserved mummy of King Tutankhamun, discovered in 1922 by archaeologist Howard Carter in the Valley of the Kings.
Tutankhamun ruled Egypt during the 18th dynasty, becoming pharaoh at a very young age.
His tomb was found almost completely intact, filled with treasures, artifacts, and his golden burial mask.
The discovery of his mummy provided historians with a rare opportunity to study the burial practices of Ancient Egypt.
The body showed signs of injuries and diseases, leading to many theories about his early death.
Despite dying young, Tutankhamun left behind a legacy that continues to fascinate the world today.
His mummy represents not just a young king, but a symbol of the rich and mysterious Egyptian civilization.
Modern scientific studies, including CT scans and DNA tests, have revealed important details about his life and health.
Tutankhamun’s mummy remains one of the most iconic archaeological discoveries in history.
Today, it rests inside his tomb (KV62) in the Valley of the Kings, protected and preserved for future generations.

        The Great Sphinx of Giza is one of the most iconic monuments in Egypt.
        It is a massive limestone statue of a reclining sphinx, a mythical creature with the body of a lion and the head of a human.
        The Sphinx is believed to have been built during the reign of Pharaoh Khafre around 2500 BC.
        It measures about 73 meters long and 20 meters high, making it one of the largest statues in the world.
        The face of the Sphinx is thought to represent Pharaoh Khafre himself.
        Over the centuries, the Sphinx has suffered erosion and damage, including the loss of its nose.
        Many mysteries surround the Sphinx, including questions about its true age and hidden chambers beneath it.
        It stands on the Giza Plateau near the famous Pyramids, attracting millions of visitors every year.
        The Sphinx symbolizes strength, wisdom, and protection in ancient Egyptian culture.
        Today, it remains a powerful symbol of Egypt’s rich history and architectural genius.
