            <p> The “Foremost of Noble Ladies,” Hatshepsut’s achievements as a powerful queen and then a ruling pharaoh have made her one of the most famous figures in ancient Egypt history.

            <h3>Mummy of King Merenptah</h3>
           
            <p> Merenptah was the thirteenth son of Ramses II and his second Great Royal Wife. Due to his father’s very long reign, he ascended the throne at a more advanced age, and ruled for only about 11 years. He was an active king, engaging in a number of military campaigns: he held off a coalition of the Libyans and Sea Peoples that attacked Egypt’s Delta in his fifth regnal year; and put down a rebellion in Nubia. One of the most important artifacts of his time, the “Israel Stela,” contains the first recorded mention of Israel. </p>

            <h3>Mummy of King Thutmose IV</h3>
           
            <p> The “Dream Stela,” erected by Thutmose IV between the paws of the Great Sphinx at Giza, tells of how, as a young prince, he fell asleep in the shade of this colossal figure while hunting in the desert nearby. The Sphinx appeared to him in his dreams and instructed him to clear away the sand that covered its body; in return, he would be made the next pharaoh. This suggests that he might not have been the legitimate crown prince, but that he usurped the throne in some way. Thutmose IV carried out at least one campaign to Nubia, which may have been more of a police action than anything else. He is known to have established peaceful relations with the Mitanni, Egypt’s greatest rivals to the northeast, marrying a Mitanni princess. He is credited with building a double portico in the court fronting the Fourth Pylon at Karnak; also at Karnak, he built a small chapel of Egyptian alabaster. </p>
